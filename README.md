# ts-compiler-errors

Documentation on TypeScript's compiler errors, including a guide on how to fix them.

### Problematic errors

Many TypeScript errors include contextual information that is unique to the code which causes the error. TypeScript includes this information in `{0}` sections in the documentation. I try to include a representative example of the error, but as these errors are generic, it is easy to miss a case in which they trigger. Please open an issue if the documentation doesn't include a sample which is similar to your problem.

Some errors I haven't been able to figure out how to trigger, along with the code I expected to trigger the error, so they cannot be documented. If you can cause one of these, please open an issue!

- TS1012 - Incredibly generic...
- TS1020 - `{ [a: string = 'a']: any }`
- TS1022 - `{ [a]: any }`
