Since rest parameters will always be defined, even if no arguments are passed to the function, it doesn't make sense for them to have initializers.

```ts
function test(...args: number[] = [1, 2, 3]) {}
```

If you need the first few arguments to have initializers, you can move them out of the rest parameter or destructure the argument and default the first few members there.

```ts
function test(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, ...rest: number[]) {}
// or
function test(...[a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, ...rest]: number[]) {}
```
