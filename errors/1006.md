When using [Triple-Slash Directives](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/triple-slash-directives.html), if a file references itself, this error will appear. To fix the issue, just remove the reference. It is unnecessary as you can already access everything in the file.

```ts
// test.ts

/// <reference path="./test.ts" />
```
