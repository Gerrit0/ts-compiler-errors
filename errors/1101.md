Whenever strict mode is enabled either explicitly with `'use strict'` or implicitly through the use of modern JavaScript features, the `with` statement is disabled.

```ts
export {} // Implicitly enables strict mode

const a = 2
const scope = { a: 1 }
with(scope) {
  a // ?
}
```

To fix the error, don't use `with`, explicitly reference the variable or property you want. See also [TS2410](?code=2410)
