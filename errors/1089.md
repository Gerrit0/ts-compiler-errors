Some modifiers cannot be applied to class constructors.

```ts
class A {
  static constructor()
  abstract constructor()
  async constructor()
  readonly constructor() {}
}
```

Static constructor methods cannot be named `constructor` as the `constructor` property already exists on objects and refer to the constructor of the object. `create` is a common alternative name. Similarly, `async` can be applied to a `static` "constructor". Marking a constructor as `abstract` doesn't make sense since `abstract` only refers to members of the instance of a class. Constructors cannot be assigned to, so `readonly` doesn't make sense.

```ts
class A {
  static create(): A

  static async createAsync(): Promise<A>

  constructor() {}
}
```
