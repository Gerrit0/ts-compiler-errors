<!-- TODO: It seems like this also might be triggered by missing a `lib` which includes PromiseLikeConstructor -->

When targeting ES3 or ES5, async functions which try to declare a non-promise return type will throw this error.

```ts
class A {
  async method(): number {
    return 1
  }
}
```

The return type is incorrect because `async` methods *always* return a promise. To fix the error, correct the return type.

```ts
class A {
  async method(): Promise<number> {
    return 1
  }
}
```
