When splitting property access over multiple lines, if an identifier is placed on the line after a `.` and there is a second identifier separated by a space, this error can appear.

```ts
const a = { return: 1 }
a.
return a
```

Note that the property name does not need to be a keyword to trigger this error, but if the property name is not a keyword more errors will be reported.

To fix this issue, move the property onto the same line as the previous symbol, or place a semicolon before the second identifier.

```ts
const a = { return: 1 }
a.return
a

// or
a
.return; a
```
