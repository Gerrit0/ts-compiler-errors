When defining an `enum` in a declaration file, it might seem convenient to save the value of a member in a variable which the `enum` references.

```ts
declare const aVal = 1

export enum A {
  a = aVal
}
```

While this is valid in `*.ts` files, it is not valid in declaration files. To fix the error move the value into the `enum`.

```ts
declare const aVal = 1

export enum A {
  a = 1 /* aVal */
}
```
