It is not possible to mark all properties as `readonly` by marking the container as `readonly`.

```ts
readonly class A {
    static x = 1
}
readonly const a = { a: 1 }
```

To fix the error, move the `readonly` declaration into the object for classes.

```ts
class A {
    readonly static x = 1
}
```

For objects, you can use const assertions to deeply mark the object as readonly.

```ts
const a = { a: 1 } as const
```
