Similar to it not making sense for statements to be included in declaration files, initializers should be replaced with the equivalent type declaration.

```ts
declare module "some-npm-module" {
  export let a = 1
}
```

Should be replaced with:

```ts
declare module "some-npm-module" {
  export let a: number
}
```
