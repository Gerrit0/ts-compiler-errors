If a `break` statement is placed outside of a loop or switch statement, this error will occur.

```ts
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++)
  console.log(i)
  break
```

To fix the error, ensure all `break` statements are enclosed within the body of a loop or switch statement.

```ts
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i)
  break
}
```
