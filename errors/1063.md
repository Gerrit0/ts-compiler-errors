Namespaces are defined in TS with an object which may have properties. Using `export =` indicates the object should be replaced with that value, which doesn't make sense.

```ts
namespace NS {
  export = function () {}
}
```

To fix the error, remove the namespace and directly create the export, or export it on a property.

```ts
function NS () {}
// or
namespace NS {
  export function fn () {}
}
```
