This error appears when the type of a class' constructor is over specified.

```ts
class A {
  constructor(): A {}
}
```

To fix the error, just remove the type annotation. TypeScript already knows what the constructor returns.

```ts
class A {
  constructor() {}
}
```

If you need to lie about the return type of a constructor (for mixins or other dynamic techniques) you can cast the class itself.

```ts
class A {
  constructor() {}
} as unknown as MyClassType
```
