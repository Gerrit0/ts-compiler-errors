When targeting ES3, `get` and `set` accessors are not available. This is expected as they were not supported (even in a transpilable form) until ES5.1 when `Object.defineProperty` was defined.

```ts
class A {
  get value() {
    return 1
  }
}
```

To fix the error, either drop support for IE 8 and switch to ES5, or use getter/setter methods.

```ts
class A {
  getValue() {
    return 1
  }
}
```
