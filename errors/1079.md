Whether in a declaration file or a regular TypeScript file, imports are already declared, so it doesn't make sense to add the `declare` keyword to the import.

```ts
declare import * as ts from 'typescript'
```

To fix the error, just remove the `declare` keyword.

```ts
import * as ts from 'typescript'
```
