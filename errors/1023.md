Objects in JavaScript can only have `string` keys. If you try to access a key with an object, the `toString` method on the object will be called before it is used as a key. This error protects you from creating keys which cannot be accessed.

```ts
interface A {
    [index: { a: boolean }]: any
}
```

If you are writing types like this, you probably actually want a `Map`

```ts
type A = Map<{ a: boolean }, any>
```
